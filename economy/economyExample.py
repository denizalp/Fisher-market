# Furthermore since every worker is also a buyer |buyer| = |workers|

#### Check if the iterative process converges
# Linear Utilities
Q, p, X, w, B = market1.solve(0.001, supplyB, "linear", "linear", printResults = True) # Converges

# Quasilinear Utilities
Q, p, X, w, B = market1.solve(0.001, supplyB, "linear", "linear", printResults = True) # For this one definitely contraction




############ Example 2 ############

##### Check if the iterative process converges

# Linear Utilities

############ Example 3: Not contraction (because goods are not good?) ############

# Matrix of valuations of buyers/workers: |buyers| x |goods|

# Matrix of valuations of firms: |firms| x |workers|

# Budgets of firms: |buyers|
supplyB = np.array([150, 250])

# Create Market
market1 = e.Economy(supplyV, supplyB, demandV)

#### Check if the iterative process converges

# Linear Utilities
Q, p, X, w, B = market1.solve(0.001, supplyB, "linear", "linear", printResults = True) # For this one definitely contraction

############ Example 4 ############

# Matrix of valuations of buyers/workers: |buyers| x |goods|
